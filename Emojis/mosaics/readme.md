# Mosaics

Mosaics are sets of emojis that are meant to be posted together, usually in a two-dimensional array.  When entering an emoji into Slack, it automatically adds a space.  But if you remove that space, the two emojis align perfectly.  Using this, large murals made up of emojis can be created.

# SlackEmojiSets

This is a compendium of emojis that I've used and seen used in various Slack workspaces.

The emojis used in a particular workspace reflect the culture in that workspace.  I've tried to remove any emojis that identify people or specific culture aspects that were distinct to the workspaces I've taken these from.

I've also edited or replaced some of the images.  Not everyone has image editing skills, and my own are admittedly basic.

1. I prefer transparent backgrounds where possible so that the image works in both light and dark modes.
2. It's also important to understand that because these are emojis and will appear quite small, there's a lot of forgiveness in image resolution.  In fact, Slack imposes a 128 KB limit.
3. Where the image is a silhouette, it should either be a color that can stand out against both light and dark backgrounds or have a contrasting outline.

I've tried to organize them into collections.  Take a subfolder or pick and choose.

## Batch-uploading into Slack

[This blog post](https://manychat.com/blog/quick-tip-how-to-bulk-upload-custom-slack-emojis/) is a good guide to batch-upload emojis into Slack.  It involves a Chrome extension, so use at your discretion, but as of this writing it has a decent rating.

## Contributing

I make no claim to the completion of this collection or any of the sets within it.

If you have some images you'd like to add, or if you can provide a better image than what I have, please feel free to open a PR.

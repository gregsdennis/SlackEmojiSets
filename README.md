# SlackEmojiSets

This is a compendium of emojis that I've used and seen used in various Slack workspaces.

I've edited or replaced some of them to make them... better.  I prefer transparent backgrounds where possible so that the image works in both light and dark modes.

Where possible, I've tried to organize them into collections where possible.

## Uploading into Slack

[This blog post](https://manychat.com/blog/quick-tip-how-to-bulk-upload-custom-slack-emojis/) is a good guide to batch-upload emojis into Slack.  It involves a Chrome extension, so use at your discretion, but as of this writing it has a decent rating.

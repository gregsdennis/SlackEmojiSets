# SlackEmojiSets

This is a compendium of emojis that I've used and seen used in various Slack workspaces (that are appropriate for sharing).

I've edited or replaced some of them to make them... better.

1. I prefer transparent backgrounds where possible so that the image works in both light and dark modes.
2. It's also important to understand that because these are emojis and will appear quite small, there's a lot of forgiveness in image resolution.  In fact, Slack imposes a 128 KB limit.

I've tried to organize them into collections.  Take a subfolder or pick and choose.

## Batch-uploading into Slack

[This blog post](https://manychat.com/blog/quick-tip-how-to-bulk-upload-custom-slack-emojis/) is a good guide to batch-upload emojis into Slack.  It involves a Chrome extension, so use at your discretion, but as of this writing it has a decent rating.

## Contributing

I make no claim to the completion of this collection or any of the sets within it.

If you have some images you'd like to add, or if you can provide a better image than what I have, please feel free to open a PR.
